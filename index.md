Hi! I'am **Erwan Serandour**.

I recently graduated from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch) with a Master's in Communication Systems. I'm currently looking for a job after completing my master's thesis on [Immediate tracing for smoother debugging and code exploration](https://github.com/thurgarion2/PrintWizard).

I'm interested in application development and programming languages, especially development practices; here are some examples:
* Categories of programming languages;
* Web development;

The best bookðŸ“• on programming I've read recently is [*The Art of Unix Programming*](https://www.amazon.com/UNIX-Programming-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computng/dp/0131429019).
